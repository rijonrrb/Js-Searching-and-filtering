<h3>Description</h3>

Team GX1 solid state drive is 4 times faster than the traditional hard drive. It can not only speed up boot time, shutdown time and the response time of applications but also lightweight and easy to carry. It is absolutely the best product to replace the traditional hard drive GX1 solid state drive is using SATA III 6Gbps specification and there are 120GB, 240GB, 480GB, 960GB, 4 capacities available to choose from. Now we talk about 120 GB versions. The sequential read/write speed is up to 500 and 320 MB/s. It not only greatly improves the performance of the computer, but also the best bargain for upgrading your desktop computer or laptop. GX1 solid state drive supports the Windows TRIM optimization command which is able to release unused space (Free Blocks) to be used for system writes immediately. This can speed up the transfer and write performance of the SSD, and also effectively reduces performance degradation and depletion chances. It perfectly maintains the effective operation and prolongs the service life of the SSD. GX1 solid state drive’s built-in smart algorithm management mechanism has functions such as garbage collection, which is able to ensure operational efficiency and prolong the service life of the SSD. Meanwhile, the powerful Wear-Leveling technology and ECC (Error Correction Code) function can enhance the reliability of data transfer.<br><br>
